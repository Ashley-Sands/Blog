Hello There, Im Ashley Sands a <span id='age'>29 (2020)</span> year old programmer, currently based in a small sea-side town in 
[Cornwall, UK](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cornwall/@50.4419899,-5.5177942,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x486ab7f0bf270ec9:0x6e423c85d94b4571!8m2!3d50.2660471!4d-5.0527125').  


At present time, i'm studying (BSc) Computing for Game (computer science with a focus on games) at (Falmouth University)[https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/computing-for-games]
Before starting my studies at Falmouth, I was a chef for roughly 15 years and acquired my NVQ Levels 1, 2 & 3 in catering at 
(Conrwall collage, Camborn)[https://www.cornwall.ac.uk/]

Mid way through completing my NVQ level 2 at Camborne, I found the joys of programing (roughly <span id='start-years-ago'>12 (2020)</span> years ago).

Back then i played a tiny parting in running a small (and to be honest, looking back, slightly dodge) shoutcast radio station. Which inspired me to learn web development, with the aim to set up my own shoutcast radio station. Over the next couple of years I taught myself JavaScript and PHP (along with HTML and CSS).

Following that, i had a bit of timeout from programing, due to work commitments and also started DJing around town and filled a regular slot on (DirtyBass.FM)[http://dirtybass.fm].

The late nights DJing and early morning cooking, almost killed me, so i evenly packed in DJing and replaced with it with game development using (Unity)[https://unity.com] (back in the 3.x days), and i haven't looked back since tho it was a couple of years before i decided i wanted career change and take my programing to the next level.


In 2018 i finaly made the leap and started studing Computing for Games at Falmouth University. 

To be honest, it was the best decision I've made in years, during my time there (so far) it has confirmed that programming is what I want to do with my life.
