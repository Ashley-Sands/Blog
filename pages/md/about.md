Hello, Im Ashley Sands, <span id="age">29 (2020)</span> year old programer from a small sea-side town in [Cornwall, UK](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cornwall/@50.4419899,-5.5177942,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x486ab7f0bf270ec9:0x6e423c85d94b4571!8m2!3d50.2660471!4d-5.0527125').



At the present time, I'm studying BSc Computing for Games at [Falmouth University](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/computing-for-games). 



Before starting my studies at Falmouth, I was a chef for roughty 13 years, during my time spent in the hospitality industry, I acquired NVQ level 1, 2 & 3 in catering at [Cornwall College, Camborne](https://www.cornwall.ac.uk/).



It was during my time at Cambone, that i found a love for programing. At the time, i played a small part in running an online shoutcast radio station and forum. Which inspired me to learn PHP and JavaScript along with HTML, CSS and MySQL. After a few years designing websites in my free time, I found the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/) (back in 4.x days) and I haven't really looked back since.



In 2018 i finally decided to follow my passion for game development and programming which led me to apply for a placement at Falmouth University. During my time at Falmouth (so far) I have completed a number of individual projects ranging from a small in-game graphic editor made with [pyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news), a custom game controller made with [Ardiuno](https://www.arduino.cc/) complete with a game made in [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). Along with a simple SQLight HTTP server which interfaced with a python/pyQT SQLight Database explorer and game made using [Epic's Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) utilizing both C++ and blueprints. During the SQLight project I became rather fond of creating applications that interface over the web, and decided to take distributed systems as my choice of specialism. During the specialism module, I went on to create my largest of all the individual projects at uni, creating a completely custom and scalable solution for an online muli-player role-play-game. The project contained multiple modules written in python, ranging from a reverse proxy and authentication module through to the actual game model itself, all running in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers and interfacing with a game made with Unity, achieving a mark of 87. 



On top of the individual projects, we must make a game each year in multi-discipline teams (programers, artis, designers and animators) which have a major focus on agile practices most notably using the lean and scrum methodology. One of which was an audio rhythmic mobile platformer made in the Unreal engine, mostly written in C++ and a small amount of blueprints. The project itself posed a number of technical challenges, including the timing of user inputs lining up with events in audio. 



During the first summer break at uni I took part in a short 2 week event at [Blue Fruit](https://www.bluefruit.co.uk/training/) called the Agile Huddle, where we made an automatic plant water using the raspberry Pi 3 in groups of 6/7 people. During the event we would have a product owner (PO) come in every 3 days, to discuss the progress of the project and spirit plan for the next 3 days, which was followed up with a sprint retrospective (what went well, what didn't go so well ect.. ) along with daily stand-ups. Furthermore there was a major focus on test-driven development (TTD), which I found to be an interesting and incredibly enjoyable approach to programing and development.



At the end of the second year at Falmouth I was offered the chance to take part in an [Azure fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) course where I went on to gain the fundamentals certification. 
This then led me to continue the multiplayer game server project, and write a small application in python to interface with the Azure CLI to automatically scale the solution as required. Followed by creating my own continuous integration (CI) server using docker containers and interfaces with both GitHub and BitBucket webhooks along with a basic user interface.



If there's anything that i've learned while at uni, I still love dev-ops just as much as creating games, both pose different technical and yet interesting issues to overcome. 
Who knows where i'll go next with all this, but what i do know is i love to solve problems and overcome difficult technical issues however big or small the problem is and this is the direction i want to take my life in.
